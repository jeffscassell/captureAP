The intent for this script is to set up a capture AP (access point) on a Linux distribution so that capturing wireless device traffic can be done easily and reliably. It is essentially a man-in-the-middle configuration.

Sometimes when launching the AP it will not indicate any errors, but the AP will not be visible. Simply running the script once or twice more fixes it.
